The purpose of this project was to reinforce and build upon the knowledge I have learned within the last 3 months (June-August 2016) about AngularJS and Javascript. While also creating something that I was interested in and that can be used by others, Football. 

This project involves use the of; multiple API's, $http post/get requests on client/server side, JSON, caching, Node.js, SMTP, localStorage, bootstraping, responsiveness, SAP and much more.

What this project 'hopefully' provides is a place where football fans can visit, to check out dynamic information about their own or any football team in the barclays premier league. This information includes; bpl clubs, match results, season long fixture list, individual players and news. 

The major attraction to this website would be that mostly everything the user sees is dynamically being fetched from remote API's, ensuring up to date information.
